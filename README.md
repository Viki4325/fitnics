# Fitnics | Vision Statement

The Fitness Tracking App (Fitnics) is a platform which stores tips and tools for two
main important aspects of a healthy life ,which are diet and exercise, by simply
entering weight, height, and age information. It can allow users to see the daily
food consumption limits, statically derived from scientific research and provide
tips and tools to help users achieve their fitness goals.

Fitnicsâ€™ scope of user contains anyone from any age and gender who want to
achieve a healthy lifestyle. The user can be someone just starting their body
building journey or who has health conditions requiring a detailed approach to
diet management.

At the heart of Fitnics lies the main page where users can see their progress and
achievements derived from their input. Users can see how many calories they can
consume to achieve a daily caloric deficit. This can be adjusted based on body
type and activity level. Any progress of diet and exercise is reflected on the main
page.

In the diet management panel, users can easily type and view nutrition facts of
any food or drink. Fitnics provides a simple panel to adjust food amount. This
helps users easily decide to consume that food. If consumed, users can log the
food and amount of calorie allowed is updated.

If the users want to go for even-better approach, they can create a weekly meal
plan and log their diet progress based on this meal plan. Fitnics can also send food
notifications to remind about time sensitive consumption.

In the exercise management panel, users can search for workouts based on
intensity, body part or benefits. Users can either log the workouts done one by
one or create a weekly plan to track their exercise progress in a more organized
way. During the workouts, users can log their start and finish times, how many
sets and repetitions performed for weighted workouts and pace for cardio
exercises.

Lastly, Fitnics allows users to interact with other users by viewing their progress
on diet and exercise and leaving comments on their journey. This way, users can
keep each other encouraged about keeping up with dedication and motivation
towards their goals.

One of the most important goals that Fitnics want to achieve is to give its users
the ability to view their progress with graph and charts which helps users to
analyze their progress over time to spot inefficiencies and implement
improvements.

Fitnics will be a significant improvement over current platforms out there which
do not provide diet and exercise management tools together. Fitnics considers
these two as critical aspects of healthy life and therefore provides an extensive
platform to gather all the tips and tools for its users in one place.

This project is considered successful if the following two criteria are satisfied. Within a month after
launching, it achieves an average rating of 4.0 or more on the app store. Within a month after
launching, we receive at least one review that has succeeded in reaching their target weight.
