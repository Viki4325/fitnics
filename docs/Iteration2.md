Retrospective
-------------

In the last iteration, we found that we underestimated the time required to complete the user story. At the end of iteration 1, we had to transfer several important features and user stories to the next iteration. So in this iteration, we slightly increased the estimated time required to complete each user story. 

We also realized that we need to do our best to write neat code, in this way we can understand more clearly what the professor is teaching. 

In the last few days of Iteration 1, because of the lack of communication and cooperation, we have to fix a lot of conflicts in the last few days. In order to solve this problem, we will communicate more frequently, and decide to push to the repository immediately after each feature or user story is completed to test and fix the conflicts with other team members.

The issue was that the UI was working Incorrectly, The UI needs to show values properly. set limits for the vlaues and completly redesigned the layout of the Page so that the value was stored as a float instead of a double.[Fix](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/fitnics-group-12/-/commit/417afb867c3013718cc1c52f7b710b84c08f6ed8)

[Link](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/fitnics-group-12/-/issues/27) Use an exception, not strings

[Link](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/fitnics-group-12/-/issues/26) Logic/magic numbers in the UI
The issue was That we used constants, this makes it difficult to read and is a bad programing practice. We created a class and made functions to do the convertions instead of constants. [Fix](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/fitnics-group-12/-/commit/cba899ff033062651c7488752891b1df7a1c5a1e).
