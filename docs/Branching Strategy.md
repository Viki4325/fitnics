# Fitnics | Branching Strategy

For this project, our team will be using GitHub flow. So, when working on any new feature or any bug fix, we will be creating a branch. The branch names will be descriptively named, enough to describe what work is being done in that branch.
When it is finished, it is merged back into the master with a merge commit. This will allow our team members to easily create and collaborate on seperate
features safely.
