        <span>Discuss some of the issues that arose during development. (both positive and negative)</span><br><br>
        During development we found that there was never enough time to complete all the work we set out for ourselves. In iteration one we finished only about half of what we wanted to. In iteration two again we only finished about half of what we set out to do, but we did finish everything we set out to do for iteration one. With iteration three we had to remove some features and rework the ones we were keeping in order to finish iteration three. So the set back in iteration one really affected the entire development process and we were playing catchup right to the end.<br><br>
        <span>The areas you identified for improvement after iteration 2 retrospective: how did it go?</span><br><br>
        The feature list rework went well and we trimmed the fat of the project to make it more streamlined and a better product. We also fixed the code issues that were found in iteration two. In general our iteration two retrospective was more positive then negative so the group feels really good about the project after iteration two.<br><br>
        <span>How did the project change from your initial vision or stories?</span><br><br>
        As mentioned we had to remove some features from our initial design. Although this doesnâ€™t remove much functionality since all of the three features were part of the same functionality which was inter app communication. Which would have allowed users to chat with each other and motivate or compete with one another. This is a blow to the overall idea of the app but this allowed us to make a better product overall which is more important.<br><br>
        <span>What went wrong in the development process?</span><br><br>
        We underestimated the time it would take for certain features to be completed and how our other courses would take up our time. So fell behind in our development process and could never really catch up. Git was also a major roadblock in our development process since none of us were experienced in it. It took us a long time to do anything in it, slowing our overall progress down.<br><br>
        <span>What did you learn about team or large project development?</span><br><br>
        We learned that we need to dedicate more time early in the project so that we can learn and develop the skills we will need to make later parts of the project easier. We also learned that we need a set goal for each member of the team at all times so that they can know what they are required to finish by the end of the iteration. In iteration one we were a bit more loose on what we assigned to people and it caused less to get done. We learned that we need to manage our time better since there will always be multiple things we have to get done but we need to be able to set aside enough time for the project to allow us to get our section of the project done.<br><br>
